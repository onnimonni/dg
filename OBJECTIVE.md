# Making things explicit
There's a lot of silent information in the world.
Typically when software is developed we only focus on writing code but we forget to answer why are we doing what we are doing in the first place.

Our goal is to create tools which both humans and claude code can use. Claude should automatically keep track of knowledge graph related to running a software company.

PII should be avoided on hiring and customers.

Searching from the knowledge graph is essential.

Putting the Knowledge into git versioning system is essential.

If something is unclear we want to work towards the first principles and write them down. Then it's easier to make complex decision making graphs based on those.

We want to use idiomatic documents which have already been proved in the software industry if possible.

There should be a cli tool to use this both for humans and LLMs.

It should be able generate websites from this information so that humans can visualize the graphs and find items and their relations easily.

It should be performant enough that when Claude asks data from the decision graph it would not need to wait for a long time.

This way we can make everything very explicit and keep challenging our shallow decisions.
