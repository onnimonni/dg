# The Story of Microsoft

Based on Acquired Podcast (Volume I, Volume II, and The Steve Ballmer Interview).

## Act I: The founding (1975-1980)

### The Spark
It began with a magazine cover. In January 1975, Paul Allen found Bill Gates at Harvard and showed him the issue of *Popular Electronics* featuring the Altair 8800. It was the first "personal computer," but it was just a kit of parts with switches and lights. It had no software.

Bill and Paul realized that the revolution was starting *now*. If they didn't provide the software layer for these new machines, someone else would. Bill dropped out of Harvard, and they moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico (where the Altair maker, MITS, was located), to start "Micro-Soft."

### The "Capitalist Woodstock"
Their first product was BASIC for the Altair. It was a technical marvel, squeezed into 4KB of memory. But hobbyists weren't used to paying for software. They copied it freely on paper tapes.

In 1976, Bill Gates wrote his famous "Open Letter to Hobbyists," effectively declaring war on piracy and establishing the fundamental business model of the software industry: **Software is a product that must be purchased.** This was a controversial but company-defining stance.

### The Move Home
By 1979, recruiting top talent to Albuquerque was impossible. Microsoft moved "home" to the Seattle area (Bellevue). This decision created the Seattle tech ecosystem and allowed them to hire the engineers who would build the company's future.

## Act II: The Deal of the Century (1980-1990)

### The IBM Partnership
In 1980, IBM woke up. The giant of the industry decided to enter the PC market and needed an operating system fast. They came to Microsoft (after failing to deal with Digital Research).

Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer pulled off the greatest business maneuver in history. They didn't even have an OS. They bought a "Quick and Dirty Operating System" (QDOS) from a local developer (Tim Paterson) for a pittance, renamed it MS-DOS, and licensed it to IBM.

Crucially, **they didn't sell it exclusively.** They kept the rights to license MS-DOS to other manufacturers. When the IBM PC became a standard, "clone" makers (Compaq, Dell, HP) rushed in. They all needed the standard OS. Microsoft owned the chokepoint of the entire industry.

### The Bundle (Office)
While the OS printed money, Microsoft also conquered the application layer. Instead of selling a word processor (Word) and a spreadsheet (Excel) separately, they bundled them into "Microsoft Office." They discounted the bundle so aggressively that it killed the category competitors (WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3). If you were a business, you bought Office. Period.

## Act III: The Windows Bridge (1990-1995)

Apple had the Macintosh. It was beautiful, graphical, and easy to use. DOS was ugly and text-based. Microsoft needed a GUI.

They built Windows. At first, it was terrible (Windows 1.0, 2.0). But it was a bridge. It allowed the millions of existing DOS users to slowly migrate to a GUI without throwing away their hardware or software.

In 1990, Windows 3.0 shipped. It was "good enough." It decimated the Mac in market share because it ran on cheap hardware from a thousand different manufacturers.

## Act IV: The Internet Tidal Wave (1995)

In 1995, Netscape went public. The Internet was exploding. Bill Gates wrote the "Internet Tidal Wave" memo, realizing that the browser threatened to replace Windows as the platform.

He pivoted the entire company. Every product group had to answer: "How does this work with the Internet?" They built Internet Explorer, bundled it with Windows, and crushed Netscape (leading to the major antitrust trial).

## Summary
Microsoft's history is defined by aggressive strategic pivots:
1.  **Founding**: Betting on software when hardware was king.
2.  **IBM/DOS**: Owning the platform standard, not the hardware.
3.  **Windows**: Bridging the command line to the GUI.
4.  **Office**: Bundling primarily business tools into a suite.
5.  **Internet**: Ruthlessly pivoting to avoid disruption.
