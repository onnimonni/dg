# Cloud-First, Mobile-First

## Strategic Pivot

When Satya Nadella became CEO in February 2014, Microsoft faced an existential challenge. The company had:
- Missed mobile (Windows Phone at <3% market share)
- Lagged in cloud (AWS had 5-year head start)
- Cultural stagnation ("stack ranking" destroyed collaboration)
- Stock price flat for a decade

Nadella's mandate: transform Microsoft from a "devices and services" company to a "productivity and platform" company—on any device, anywhere.

## Core Principles

### 1. Cloud as Foundation
Azure becomes the company's primary growth engine. Not just infrastructure—a complete platform for modern applications.

### 2. "Mobile-First" ≠ Windows Phone
Accept that mobile means iOS and Android. Build best-in-class apps for competitor platforms (Office for iPad, Outlook Mobile).

### 3. Open Source Embrace
- Acquire GitHub ($7.5B)
- .NET goes open source
- Linux runs on Azure
- SQL Server on Linux

### 4. Growth Mindset Culture
Replace stack ranking with collaborative culture. "Learn-it-all" beats "know-it-all."

## Strategic Moves

| Year | Action | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2014 | Office for iPad | Signal: Microsoft software on any device |
| 2014 | Nadella's first email: "Our industry does not respect tradition" | Culture reset |
| 2016 | LinkedIn acquisition ($26.2B) | Professional network + data |
| 2018 | GitHub acquisition ($7.5B) | Developer community |
| 2019 | Azure revenue > Windows | Tipping point |
| 2023 | OpenAI partnership ($13B) | AI leadership position |

## Financial Transformation

| Metric | 2014 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|
| Revenue | $87B | $245B+ |
| Market Cap | $300B | $3T+ |
| Cloud Revenue | ~$4B | ~$100B |
| Azure Growth | — | 29% YoY |

## Key Insight: Platform + Apps

Ballmer's lesson learned: "You have to think app with platform." Nadella applied this by:
1. Making Office the killer app for Azure
2. Making Teams the killer app for Microsoft 365
3. Making Copilot the killer app for AI

The platform exists to serve the apps; the apps drive platform adoption.

## Cultural Transformation

From internal competition ("murder boards") to:
- Cross-team collaboration
- Open source contribution
- Customer obsession over competitor fixation
- Long-term thinking over quarterly optimization

## The Three Ambitions

1. **Reinvent productivity** — Microsoft 365 as work's operating system
2. **Build the intelligent cloud** — Azure as the world's computer
3. **Create more personal computing** — Windows, Surface, Gaming

This strategy reversed a decade of stagnation and made Microsoft the world's most valuable company.
