# Bundle Applications into 'Microsoft Office'

## Setting
Microsoft has successful individual apps: Word, Excel, PowerPoint. Competitors (WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3) are strong in specific verticals. Microsoft realizes that business customers use all these tools.

## People
- **Responsible**: Mike Maples, Bill Gates
- **Approvers**:
- **Consulted**:
- **Informed**:

## Alternatives

### Option A: Sell Apps Individually (Best-of-Breed)
**Pros:**
- Higher margin per unit.
- Standard industry practice.

**Cons:**
- Allows competitors to survive in niches (Lotus in spreadsheets, WordPerfect in writing).

### Option B: Bundle as a Suite (Office)
**Pros:**
- Massive value proposition ("Get 3 for price of 1.5").
- Locks out competitors (users won't buy Lotus if they already have Excel in the bundle).
- Standardizes the UI/UX across apps (common menus).
- Cross-app integration (OLE).

**Cons:**
- Cannibalizes individual sales.
- Antitrust concerns (bundling).

## Decision
Chosen: **Option B**

Rationale: The "Suite" is the product. By integrating them and discounting the bundle, Microsoft creates an unbeatable moat. It's the "cookie cutter" strategy—once a business standardizes on Office, they never switch.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Office becomes the dominant productivity standard.
- Generates massive, recurring revenue.
- Kills Lotus and WordPerfect.

### Negative
- Antitrust scrutiny increases.
