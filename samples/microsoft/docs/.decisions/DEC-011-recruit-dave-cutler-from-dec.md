# Recruit Dave Cutler from DEC

## Setting

By 1988, Microsoft needed to build a serious enterprise operating system. DOS/Windows couldn't compete with UNIX in corporate datacenters. OS/2 (with IBM) was too slow and IBM-controlled.

The solution: find the best OS architect in the world and pay whatever it takes.

## People

- **Responsible**: Bill Gates
- **Approvers**: Microsoft Board
- **Consulted**: Nathan Myhrvold
- **Informed**: DEC (after the fact)

## The Target

**David Neil Cutler** was the architect of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation—the most reliable operating system ever built. His credentials:

| Achievement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| RSX-11M (1972) | Real-time OS for PDP-11 |
| VMS (1978) | Enterprise-grade, fault-tolerant |
| Reputation | "Best systems programmer alive" |
| Work Ethic | Legendary intensity |

DEC was declining. Cutler's latest project (PRISM) had been cancelled. He was frustrated and available.

## Alternatives

### Option A: Build with Existing Team
**Rejected**: Microsoft's OS talent couldn't match DEC/IBM/UNIX veterans.

### Option B: Acquire Company with OS
**Rejected**: No suitable acquisition target.

### Option C: License/Fork Existing OS
**Rejected**: Would create dependency, limit control.

### Option D: Recruit Dave Cutler and Team
**Pros:**
- Gets the best OS architect alive
- Brings elite DEC engineering team
- Clean-sheet design, no legacy constraints
- Full Microsoft ownership

**Cons:**
- Extremely expensive
- Multi-year project (5+ years)
- Cutler's personality challenging
- DEC legal risk

## Decision

**Chosen: Option D — Recruit Cutler**

Gates personally recruited Cutler with:
- Full control over NT architecture
- Team of his choosing (20+ DEC engineers followed)
- Compensation package (salary + equity)
- Promise of resources and patience

## The Cutler Factor

### Technical Genius
Cutler's design decisions shaped computing for 35+ years:
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (portability)
- Protected memory (reliability)
- Preemptive multitasking (performance)
- Security architecture (enterprise)

### Legendary Intensity
> "Dave would work 80-hour weeks and expect everyone else to match."

His code reviews were brutal. His standards were uncompromising. Results were exceptional.

### Cultural Transplant
Cutler brought DEC's engineering culture:
- Documentation-first design
- Rigorous testing
- Long-term thinking
- Zero tolerance for shortcuts

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Windows NT** — Enterprise-grade OS shipping 1993
2. **Server dominance** — NT became Windows Server
3. **Platform unification** — NT kernel powers Windows 11
4. **Azure infrastructure** — Cutler later built Azure hypervisor
5. **Talent magnet** — Best engineers wanted to work with Cutler

### Negative

1. **5-year timeline** — NT 3.1 didn't ship until July 1993
2. **Resource intensive** — $150M+ development cost
3. **Cultural friction** — DEC-vs-Microsoft tension
4. **Hardware requirements** — NT needed expensive machines initially

## Cutler's Continued Impact

| Project | Years | Impact |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Windows NT | 1988-1996 | Enterprise OS foundation |
| Windows 2000 | 1997-2000 | Mainstream enterprise |
| Xbox | 2001-2003 | Real-time kernel work |
| Azure | 2006-present | Cloud hypervisor |

At 80+, Cutler reportedly still codes at Microsoft.

## The Quote

> "Dave is the best systems programmer in the world. If we didn't get him, someone else would, and they would build the operating system of the future instead of us." — Bill Gates

This hire is one of the most consequential talent acquisitions in technology history.
