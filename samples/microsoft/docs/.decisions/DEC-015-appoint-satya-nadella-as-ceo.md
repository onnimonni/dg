# Appoint Satya Nadella as CEO

## Setting

February 2014. Steve Ballmer announced retirement in August 2013. After 6-month search:

- **Microsoft's situation**: Stock flat for 14 years, missed mobile, cloud trailing AWS
- **Candidates considered**: Internal (Nadella, Elop, Qi Lu) and external (Ford CEO Mulally)
- **Board's realization**: Needed transformation, not continuation

## People

- **Responsible**: Microsoft Board, John Thompson (Lead Director)
- **Approvers**: Full Board, Bill Gates
- **Consulted**: Steve Ballmer, Executive team
- **Informed**: Employees, Shareholders, Industry

## The Candidates

| Candidate | Background | Strengths | Concerns |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Satya Nadella** | Cloud & Enterprise VP | Cloud vision, technical depth, insider | Unproven as CEO, quieter style |
| Stephen Elop | Nokia CEO (ex-MSFT) | CEO experience, mobile focus | Nokia failure, "trojan horse" rumors |
| Alan Mulally | Ford CEO | Turnaround expert, operational excellence | Age (68), no tech background |
| Tony Bates | Skype President | M&A experience, external perspective | Less Microsoft tenure |

## Why Nadella

### The Cloud Argument
Nadella ran Cloud & Enterprise—the only division growing rapidly. He understood:
1. Azure's strategic importance
2. Enterprise customer relationships
3. Why Windows-centric thinking was limiting
4. How to compete with AWS

### The Cultural Argument
Nadella's philosophy (later articulated in "Hit Refresh"):
- **Growth mindset** over know-it-all culture
- **Customer obsession** over competitor fixation
- **Cross-team collaboration** over stack ranking
- **Long-term thinking** over quarterly optimization

### The Insider Advantage
After Ballmer's tenure, external CEO would face:
- Enormous learning curve
- Cultural resistance
- Technical complexity
- Legacy relationships

Nadella knew Microsoft deeply (22 years) while being "outside" the Windows/Office power centers.

## The Decision Process

### Board's Evolution
Initial preference: External turnaround expert (Mulally)

Why that changed:
1. Mulally's age and uncertain commitment
2. Nadella's impressive board presentations
3. Recognition that transformation needed insider knowledge
4. Gates' support for technical leader

### Gates' Role
Bill Gates agreed to return as "Technology Advisor"—spending 30% of time with Nadella. This addressed concerns about Nadella's external profile and product vision.

## Decision

**Chosen: Satya Nadella**

Announced February 4, 2014:
- Third CEO in Microsoft history
- First non-founder CEO without Ballmer/Gates sponsorship
- First CEO from cloud/enterprise rather than Windows/Office

## Nadella's Day-One Priorities

1. **Establish vision**: "Mobile-first, cloud-first" (later refined)
2. **Signal culture change**: First email to employees—"our industry does not respect tradition"
3. **Organizational reset**: Eliminate stack ranking, promote collaboration
4. **Strategic clarity**: Azure, Office 365, and cross-platform as priorities

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Stock price**: $38 → $400+ (10x in 10 years)
2. **Cloud dominance**: Azure became #2 cloud (challenging AWS)
3. **Culture transformation**: "Learn-it-all" replaced "know-it-all"
4. **Strategic acquisitions**: LinkedIn, GitHub, Activision
5. **AI leadership**: OpenAI partnership positioned Microsoft for AI era

### Negative

1. **Mobile abandoned**: Windows Phone killed (correct decision, still a loss)
2. **Consumer retreat**: Xbox survived, but consumer focus diminished
3. **Ballmer legacy**: Narrative unfairly harsh on predecessor's contributions

## The Transformation Metrics

| Metric | 2014 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|
| Revenue | $87B | $245B+ |
| Market Cap | $300B | $3T+ |
| Cloud Revenue | ~$4B | ~$100B |
| Employees | 120K | 220K+ |
| Stock Price | $38 | $400+ |

## Historical Significance

The Nadella appointment is one of the most successful CEO successions in business history:

1. **Matched leader to moment**: Cloud expertise when cloud was essential
2. **Culture over continuity**: Willingness to break from "Microsoft way"
3. **Patient transformation**: 10-year journey, not quick fix
4. **Gates' humility**: Founder stepped back to let new leader lead

> "Our industry does not respect tradition—it only respects innovation." — Satya Nadella, first email as CEO
