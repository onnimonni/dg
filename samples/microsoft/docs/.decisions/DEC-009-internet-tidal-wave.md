# The Internet Tidal Wave Memo

## Setting
It's 1995. Netscape has launched and is growing exponentially. The web is exploding. Microsoft is focused on the MSN proprietary network. Bill Gates realizes the internet is not just a feature, but a platform shift that threatens Windows. If the browser becomes the OS, Windows is irrelevant.

## People
- **Responsible**: Bill Gates (wrote the memo)
- **Approvers**:
- **Consulted**: Nathan Myhrvold, Steven Sinofsky
- **Informed**: Entire Company

## Alternatives

### Option A: Continue with MSN (Proprietary Online Service)
**Pros:**
- Control the user experience.
- Subscription revenue (like AOL).

**Cons:**
- The open web is growing faster.
- Being on the wrong side of history.

### Option B: Embrace and Extend the Internet
**Pros:**
- leveraging Windows dominance to distribute a browser (Internet Explorer).
- Integrating web protocols into the OS.
- Preventing Netscape from becoming the platform.

**Cons:**
- Requires massive internal pivot.
- Cannibalizes MSN strategy.
- Antitrust risk (bundling IE with Windows).

## Decision
Chosen: **Option B**

Rationale: "The Internet is a tidal wave. It changes the rules. It is an incredible opportunity as well as an incredible challenge." Microsoft must pivot the entire company to be "Internet-First".

## Consequences

### Positive
- Microsoft successfully caught up (Browser Wars).
- IE became dominant.
- Windows remained relevant.

### Negative
- The DOJ Antitrust case (United States v. Microsoft Corp) focused on the aggressive bundling of IE to kill Netscape.
- Distracted the company for a decade (leading to missing Mobile).
