# Enter the Console Market with Xbox

## Setting
Sony's PlayStation 2 is dominating. Microsoft fears that the game console will become the "hub" of the digital home, pushing the PC out. A small group of rebels (the DirectX team) proposes building a game console based on PC architecture.

## People
- **Responsible**: Robbie Bach, Seamus Blackley
- **Approvers**: Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer
- **Consulted**: 
- **Informed**:

## Alternatives

### Option A: Stay Pure Software (Make games for PC/PS2)
**Pros:**
- High margin.
- No hardware risk.

**Cons:**
- Sony controls the living room.
- PC gaming might die if consoles take over.

### Option B: Build the Xbox (Hardware)
**Pros:**
- Strategic defense of the Windows platform (DirectX).
- Potential to own the living room.

**Cons:**
- Microsoft has never built complex consumer hardware.
- The business model is "Razor and Blade" (lose money on hardware, make it back on games). Microsoft is used to making money on everything.
- Predicted loss of billions of dollars in the first few years.

## Decision
Chosen: **Option B**

Rationale: In a famous meeting, Bill Gates initially hated the idea (it didn't run full Windows). But when told "Sony will win the living room," he approved it. It was a strategic defensive move.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Xbox became the only successful new American console.
- Created Halo (a massive cultural franchise).
- Established Microsoft as a consumer hardware maker (paving way for Surface).

### Negative
- Lost billions of dollars for years.
- The "Red Ring of Death" disaster (costing $1B+ to fix).
