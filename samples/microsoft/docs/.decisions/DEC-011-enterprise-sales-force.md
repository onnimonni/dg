# Build a Massive Enterprise Sales Force

## Setting
In the early 90s, Microsoft was primarily a consumer/OEM company. They sold box products and licenses to computer makers. To conquer the Fortune 500, they needed a different approach. They needed to talk to CIOs, not just users.

## People
- **Responsible**: Steve Ballmer
- **Approvers**: Bill Gates
- **Consulted**:
- **Informed**:

## Alternatives

### Option A: Rely on Resellers & Partners
**Pros:**
- High margin.
- No need to manage thousands of salespeople.

**Cons:**
- No direct relationship with large customers.
- Competitors like Oracle and IBM have direct sales teams that "own" the CIO.

### Option B: Build an Internal Enterprise Sales Machine
**Pros:**
- Direct control over the customer relationship.
- Ability to sign "Enterprise Agreements" (EAs) – long-term, all-you-can-eat software contracts.
- Feedback loop from big business to product teams.

**Cons:**
- Expensive (hiring thousands of people).
- Change in company culture (from engineering-led to sales-led).

## Decision
Chosen: **Option B**

Rationale: Steve Ballmer recognized that for Microsoft to become the infrastructure of the corporate world, they needed to sell contracts, not boxes. The Enterprise Agreement (EA) became the most powerful lock-in mechanism in software history.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Created the "Microsoft Fortress" in the enterprise.
- Generated reliable, massive recurring revenue (long before SaaS).
- Allowed Microsoft to survive the disruption of mobile/web by holding onto corporate back-ends.

### Negative
- Shifted culture towards sales; product innovation slowed down in the 2000s.
