# Publish 'Open Letter to Hobbyists'

## Setting
Micro-Soft's BASIC is wildly popular, but most users are pirating it. At a Homebrew Computer Club meeting, a paper tape of BASIC was copied and distributed for free. Bill Gates is furious because without revenue, they cannot fund development of better software. The concept of "software as a product" distinct from hardware is not yet accepted.

## People
- **Responsible**: Bill Gates
- **Approvers**: Bill Gates
- **Consulted**:
- **Informed**: Homebrew Computer Club, MITS

## Alternatives

### Option A: Ignore Piracy (Hardware-first mindset)
**Pros:**
- Builds massive user base.
- Avoids alienating the hobbyist community.

**Cons:**
- Zero revenue.
- Cannot hire engineers to improve the product.
- Sets a precedent that software is free.

### Option B: Demand Payment and Intellectual Property Rights
**Pros:**
- Establishes the business model of the software industry.
- Funds future development.

**Cons:**
- PR backlash (Computer hobbyists hated this).
- "Greedy" reputation.

## Decision
Chosen: **Option B**

Rationale: "Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?" Bill argues that good software requires professional full-time developers, which requires a sustainable business model.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Validated the software licensing model.
- Eventually accepted by the industry.
- Allowed Microsoft to grow into a real company.

### Negative
- Bill Gates labeled as a villain by some early hobbyists.
