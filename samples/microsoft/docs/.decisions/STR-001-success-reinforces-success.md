# Success Reinforces Success: The Platform Standard Strategy

## Context & Vision

Bill Gates recognized early that the software industry follows exponential dynamics fundamentally different from traditional businesses. In markets with high fixed costs and near-zero marginal costs, a slight initial advantage compounds into market dominance.

The insight came from observing Moore's Law: computing power doubles every 18 months while costs halve. This means the addressable market for software expands exponentially. The company that sets the standard captures most of this expanding pie.

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Standard-Setting Through Aggressive Pricing
Price software low enough to eliminate competitor oxygen. When "high technology products in great volume have minimal marginal cost increases," market share matters more than per-unit margin.

**Example**: Microsoft licensed BASIC to Apple for $31,000 for 8 years—far below market value—to ensure BASIC became the lingua franca of personal computing.

### 2. Positive Feedback Loops
- More users → more developers → more software → more users
- Standard language → more code written for it → must-have status → deeper entrenchment

### 3. Platform Over Applications
Control the layer that all applications depend on. Hardware is commoditized; the OS and language layer captures the value.

## Key Tenets

1. **"We want to be the IBM of software"** — Own the standard, let others compete on hardware
2. **Ubiquity over margin** — $10 from every PC beats $100 from some PCs
3. **Backward compatibility** — Never strand your installed base; they become your moat
4. **"The rising tide lifts all boats, but we own the water"**

## Metrics & Outcomes

| Year | Revenue | Market Position |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1975 | $16K | Startup |
| 1977 | $381K | BASIC standard across Trinity |
| 1980 | $8M | IBM partnership secured |
| 1985 | $140M | DOS dominance |
| 1990 | $1.18B | Windows 3.0 + Office suite |

## Long-term Impact

This strategy created one of the most durable moats in business history. By 1995, Microsoft had:
- 90%+ OS market share on PCs
- De facto standard for productivity software
- Platform lock-in through APIs and file formats
- Network effects that made switching prohibitively expensive

The strategy's success enabled Microsoft to survive the antitrust era and pivot to enterprise and cloud markets while competitors struggled to gain footing.
