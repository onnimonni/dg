# License BASIC to 1977 Trinity

## Setting

1977. Three personal computers launched that would define the industry:
- **Apple II** (April 1977)
- **Commodore PET** (January 1977)
- **RadioShack TRS-80** (August 1977)

All three needed BASIC—the standard programming language for personal computers. After winning the MITS arbitration (DEC-016), Microsoft was free to license.

The question: How to price and structure these deals?

## People

- **Responsible**: Bill Gates, Paul Allen
- **Approvers**: Gates (owner)
- **Consulted**: Kazuhiko Nishi (Japan partner)
- **Informed**: OEM partners

## The Strategic Choice

### Option A: Maximize Per-Deal Revenue
Price each deal at market value. Extract maximum dollars.

**Calculation:**
- Apple might pay $200-300K for exclusive
- Commodore similar
- RadioShack similar
- Total: ~$700K-1M

**Risk:** Some might build their own BASIC. Market fragments.

### Option B: Minimize Price, Maximize Adoption
Price aggressively low. Ensure Microsoft BASIC becomes THE standard.

**Calculation:**
- Lower per-deal revenue
- But: Ubiquitous standard = platform power
- Future leverage from installed base

## Decision

**Chosen: Option B — Aggressive pricing for ubiquity**

### Actual Deal Terms

| Company | Price | Terms |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Apple | $31,000 | 8-year license, flat fee |
| Commodore | ~$25,000 | Similar structure |
| RadioShack | ~$50,000 | TRS-80 BASIC |

**Total: ~$106,000** — Far below market value.

### Why So Cheap?

Bill Gates' exponential thinking:

1. **Standard wins everything** — If all three use Microsoft BASIC, it becomes impossible to displace
2. **Developers train on BASIC** — Code skills become Microsoft-specific
3. **Hardware commoditizes** — Multiple vendors = price competition = more PCs = more BASIC
4. **Future leverage** — Once standard, pricing power follows

> "Success reinforces success. A small advantage in the beginning can compound into market dominance." — Bill Gates

## Consequences

### Immediate

| Metric | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | $22K | $381K | $1.3M |
| OEM Partners | 1 (MITS) | 4+ | 10+ |
| Market Position | Startup | Standard | Dominant |

### Strategic

1. **BASIC standard established** — No competitor could match installed base
2. **OEM model proven** — Template for DOS licensing
3. **Platform thinking validated** — Ubiquity > per-unit margin
4. **Pricing confidence** — Willingness to sacrifice short-term for long-term

## The Japan Factor

Kazuhiko Nishi became Microsoft's exclusive Japan distributor. By 1979:
- Japan = ~50% of Microsoft revenue
- Japanese PC makers standardized on Microsoft BASIC
- International expansion validated early

## Connection to IBM Deal

The Trinity strategy made the IBM deal possible:

| Trinity Proof Point | IBM Relevance |
|---------------------|---------------|
| BASIC was standard | Microsoft only credible language partner |
| OEM model worked | Template for DOS licensing |
| Low pricing builds market | IBM got good deal, clones got same deal |
| Platform > product | Non-exclusive benefited everyone |

When IBM came calling in 1980, Microsoft had:
- Proven OEM relationships
- Track record of delivery
- Reputation as standard
- Business model that worked

## The Long View

The Trinity deals exemplify Gates' strategic genius. He could have extracted ~$1M from the 1977 market. Instead, he invested in market share.

**Return on that "investment":**
- 1977 revenue: $381K
- 1980 revenue: $8M (IBM year)
- 1990 revenue: $1.18B
- Peak market cap: $600B+ (1999)

The $31,000 Apple deal alone generated billions in downstream value through the standard it helped establish.

## Key Insight

> "The software industry has minimal marginal costs. High technology products in great volume have minimal marginal cost increases. We understood this before anyone else." — Bill Gates

This understanding—that software economics reward ubiquity over margin—became the foundation of Microsoft's 40-year dominance.
