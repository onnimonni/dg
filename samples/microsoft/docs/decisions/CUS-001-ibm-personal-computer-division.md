# IBM Personal Computer Division

## Customer Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Company** | International Business Machines (IBM) |
| **Division** | Entry Systems Division / PC Division |
| **Location** | Boca Raton, Florida |
| **Project Codename** | Project Chess |
| **Key Contact** | Jack Sams (initial), Don Estridge (project lead) |

## Strategic Importance

IBM was the most valuable company in the world (~$34B market cap in 1980). Their entry into personal computing validated the entire industry.

For Microsoft, the IBM partnership was:
1. **Market validation** — "Nobody gets fired for buying IBM"
2. **Distribution** — IBM's sales force reached every enterprise
3. **Foundation** — Template for all future OEM deals

## Relationship Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jul 1980 | Jack Sams visits Microsoft seeking languages |
| Aug 1980 | Microsoft commits to providing OS (DEC-005) |
| Aug 1980 | Microsoft acquires QDOS (DEC-006) |
| Aug 1981 | IBM PC launches with MS-DOS |
| 1983-1987 | OS/2 joint development |
| 1990 | "Divorce" — IBM goes alone with OS/2 |

## The Deal Structure

### What Microsoft Provided
- MS-DOS operating system
- BASIC interpreter
- Other languages (COBOL, Fortran, Pascal)

### What Microsoft Received
- Flat fee payments (~$80,000 initially)
- **Non-exclusive license** to DOS (POL-001)
- IBM's stamp of approval
- Template for OEM licensing model

### What IBM Got Wrong

IBM, accustomed to controlling every component, made a strategic error:

1. **Non-exclusive license** — Microsoft could sell DOS to IBM's competitors
2. **Open architecture** — PC could be cloned (Compaq, Dell, etc.)
3. **Underestimated software** — Treated OS as commodity component

> "IBM thought they were getting a cheap subcontractor. They got a strategic partner who understood the value of the platform better than they did." — Industry analyst

## Revenue Impact

| Year | IBM Revenue to MSFT | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| 1981 | ~$500K | Initial DOS + languages |
| 1982 | ~$2M | Growing PC sales |
| 1983 | ~$5M | PC AT, PC Jr |
| 1984-1989 | ~$10-15M/year | OS/2 development fees |
| 1990 | Relationship ends | |

While direct IBM revenue was modest, the **indirect value was incalculable**:
- Clone makers (Compaq, Dell, HP) became much larger customers
- IBM's imprimatur opened enterprise doors
- Established Microsoft as the standard

## The OS/2 Era (1985-1990)

### Joint Development
IBM and Microsoft collaborated on OS/2:
- IBM controlled UI/marketing
- Microsoft contributed kernel work
- Meant to replace DOS/Windows

### Why It Failed

1. **IBM bureaucracy** — Development too slow
2. **Hardware requirements** — OS/2 needed expensive RAM
3. **Microsoft's hedge** — Windows 3.0 development continued
4. **Cultural clash** — IBM's mainframe mindset vs Microsoft's speed

### The Divorce (1990)

Bill Gates chose Windows over OS/2. IBM went alone with OS/2, which eventually failed.

> "There was a year where they [Gates and Ballmer] didn't speak" — Steve Ballmer, on the OS/2 tensions

## Lessons Learned

### For Microsoft
1. Never give up control of the platform
2. Non-exclusive licensing is the key to scale
3. Big customers can be leveraged, then outgrown
4. Speed beats bureaucracy

### For IBM
1. Software is strategic, not commodity
2. Open standards can backfire
3. Partnerships can create competitors
4. "Not invented here" is expensive

## Legacy

The IBM deal transformed Microsoft from a programming languages company to the dominant platform company of the PC era. Every subsequent OEM deal used IBM as the template.

IBM eventually sold its PC division to Lenovo (2005) for $1.75B—a fraction of the value Microsoft extracted from the partnership.
