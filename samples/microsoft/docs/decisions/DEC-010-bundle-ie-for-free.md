# Bundle Internet Explorer with Windows for Free

## Setting
Netscape Navigator costs $39 and has 90% market share. Microsoft needs to deploy Internet Explorer (IE) to everyone immediately to stop Netscape from becoming the platform.

## People
- **Responsible**: Bill Gates, Brad Silverberg
- **Approvers**: Bill Gates
- **Consulted**: Legal
- **Informed**:

## Alternatives

### Option A: Sell IE as a standalone product
**Pros:**
- Follows standard business model.
- Avoids antitrust scrutiny.

**Cons:**
- User adoption will be too slow.
- Netscape already has the lead; nobody will pay for a worse product.

### Option B: Bundle IE for free and integrate it deep into Windows
**Pros:**
- Instant distribution to 100% of PC buyers.
- "Cuts off the air supply" of Netscape (who relies on browser revenue).
- Makes the browser a feature of the OS, not a separate app.

**Cons:**
- Zero revenue from the browser.
- High risk of antitrust violation (using monopoly in OS to conquer browser market).
- Breaks the "Open Letter to Hobbyists" principle that software is a product.

## Decision
Chosen: **Option B**

Rationale: "We represent that the browser is part of the operating system." Survival is more important than revenue from this specific tool. By making the browser free, Microsoft removes the business model for its competitor.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Microsoft won the Browser Wars. IE reached 95% market share.
- Netscape collapsed and was sold to AOL.

### Negative
- Direct cause of *United States v. Microsoft Corp* antitrust trial.
- Microsoft came within inches of being broken up by the government.
