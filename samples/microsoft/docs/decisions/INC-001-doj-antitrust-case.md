# DOJ Antitrust Case: United States v. Microsoft Corp

## Timeline

|------|-------|
| 1990 | FTC investigation begins (deadlocks 2-2) |
| Aug 1993 | DOJ assumes case from FTC |
| Jul 1994 | Consent decree signed (no tying apps to Windows) |
| Oct 1997 | DOJ alleges IE bundling violates decree |
| May 1998 | DOJ files comprehensive antitrust lawsuit |
| Aug 1998 | Bill Gates 20-hour deposition (INC-002) |

**Duration of regulatory scrutiny: 21 years (1990-2011)**

## Impact Assessment

### Market Cap Destruction
| Period | Market Cap | Change |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Dec 1999 | $600B | Peak |
| Late 2000 | $270B | -55% |

The breakup ruling (June 2000) crushed market confidence. Microsoft went from world's most valuable company to years of stock stagnation.

### Organizational Impact
- Bill Gates stepped down as CEO (January 2000)
- Leadership retreats derailed by morale crisis
- Brad Smith hired as General Counsel with mandate: "time to make peace"
- Engineering resources diverted to compliance
- Innovation constrained by consent decree requirements

## Root Causes

### The Browser Wars Strategy
Microsoft's December 7, 1995 announcement that IE would be free and bundled with Windows (DEC-012) was brilliant competitive strategy but created the legal exposure:

1. **Tying allegation**: IE + Windows = illegal bundle
2. **Predatory pricing**: Free product to destroy Netscape
3. **OEM restrictions**: PC makers couldn't remove IE or promote Netscape

### The Gates Deposition Disaster (INC-002)
Bill Gates' combative deposition style backfired catastrophically when video was shown in court. His evasiveness on basic facts undermined Microsoft's credibility.

## Resolution Terms (2001 Consent Decree)

1. **No exclusive OEM contracts** — PC makers could preinstall competitor software
2. **API documentation** — Must share technical interfaces with competitors
3. **Technical oversight committee** — Government-appointed compliance monitoring
4. **No retaliation** — Cannot punish OEMs who work with competitors

**What was avoided:**
- Company breakup
- Forced divestiture of Office or IE
- Structural separation requirements

## Lessons Learned

### For Microsoft
1. Aggressive competitive tactics have regulatory limits
2. Executive behavior in legal proceedings matters enormously
3. Consent decrees constrain strategy for decades
4. Winning the market while losing the courtroom is possible but costly

### For Industry
> "The antitrust case proved that even monopolies have boundaries. Microsoft won the browser war but lost a decade of innovation capacity fighting the legal war." — Industry analyst

## Long-term Consequences

**Positive:**
- Forced cultural maturation
- Brad Smith's "make peace" strategy built relationships with regulators
- Survived as unified company

**Negative:**
- Distracted leadership during critical mobile transition
- Conservative product strategy to avoid antitrust scrutiny
- Lost a generation of talent to Google and startups
- Stock price stagnation (1999-2014)

The antitrust era fundamentally redirected Microsoft from consumer dominance toward enterprise specialization—a pivot that paradoxically positioned the company for long-term profitability.
