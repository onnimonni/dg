# Tethics Framework

## Purpose

"Tethics" (Tech Ethics) is Pied Piper's formal commitment to ethical software development. While the term was coined industry-wide (ironically by Gavin Belson), we adopt it seriously as an extension of our Anti-Hooli principle.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. We Will Not Ship Unfinished Code

Software that is "good enough" is not good enough. We will:
- Complete thorough testing before any release
- Fix known bugs before adding new features
- Never sacrifice quality for arbitrary deadlines
- Maintain comprehensive documentation

**Accountability**: Engineering lead signs off on release readiness.

### 2. We Will Act in the Public Interest

Technology should serve humanity, not exploit it. We will:
- Consider societal impact of our products
- Refuse contracts that enable surveillance or harm
- Be transparent about data collection and usage
- Prioritize user benefit over engagement metrics

**Accountability**: Ethics review for major product decisions.

### 3. We Will Ensure Data Sovereignty

Users own their data. Period. We will:
- Never sell user data to third parties
- Provide full data export capabilities
- Honor deletion requests completely
- Encrypt user data end-to-end where possible

**Accountability**: Annual third-party privacy audit.

## Implementation

### Engineering Standards
- All code changes require peer review
- Security review for public-facing features
- Performance testing before deployment
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Business Standards
- No partnerships that compromise user privacy
- Transparent pricing with no hidden terms
- Clear terms of service in plain language
- Regular communication with users

### Compliance Monitoring
- Quarterly Tethics review board meeting
- Anonymous ethics violation reporting
- External ethics advisory council

## Violations

Tethics violations are treated as seriously as security breaches:

| Severity | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Minor | Documented warning, remediation plan |
| Moderate | Team review, mandatory training |
| Major | Leadership escalation, potential termination |
| Critical | Product halt, public disclosure |

## Real-World Test

The ultimate test of Tethics came with DEC-005. When faced with a choice between profit and protecting global privacy, we chose to destroy our own company rather than violate our principles.

This proves Tethics is not marketing—it's who we are.
