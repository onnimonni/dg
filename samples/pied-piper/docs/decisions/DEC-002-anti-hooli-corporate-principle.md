# Anti-Hooli Corporate Principle

## Setting

Pied Piper was founded by former Hooli employees who witnessed firsthand the dystopian corporate culture of Big Tech. Hooli's practices included:
- Restrictive non-compete clauses (illegal in California)
- Cult-like corporate spirituality programs
- User data monetization without consent
- Acquisition and burial of innovative technology

This principle establishes Pied Piper's core identity as the antithesis of Hooli.

## People

- **Responsible**: Richard Hendricks (CEO/Founder)
- **Approvers**: Founding Team (Richard, Gilfoyle, Dinesh, Erlich)
- **Consulted**: Peter Gregory (Initial Investor)
- **Informed**: All future employees and investors

## Alternatives

### Option A: Adopt Standard Silicon Valley Practices
**Pros:**
- Easier fundraising from traditional VCs
- Familiar playbook for growth
- Lower short-term friction

**Cons:**
- Perpetuates harmful industry norms
- Risk of becoming what we hate
- No differentiation from competitors

### Option B: Establish Anti-Hooli Principle
**Pros:**
- Clear ethical foundation
- Attracts mission-aligned talent
- Authentic differentiation
- User trust

**Cons:**
- May limit certain business models
- Harder to monetize
- Investors may not understand

## Decision

Chosen: **Option B - Establish Anti-Hooli Principle**

Rationale: We started this company because we believed technology should serve users, not exploit them. If we become Hooli, we've already lost.

## Core Tenets

1. **No restrictive employment contracts** - California law prohibits non-competes; we embrace this
2. **No cult-like culture** - No mandatory meditation, no corporate spirituality
3. **No data exploitation** - We will never sell user data or enable ad-mining
4. **Technology for users** - Our tech must benefit end users, not just shareholders

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear moral compass for all decisions
- Strong team alignment on values
- User trust and loyalty

### Negative
- Revenue constraints (no ad revenue)
- Some investors won't understand
- May lose deals to less principled competitors

### Follow-up Actions
- [x] Document in founding principles
- [x] Include in employee onboarding
- [x] Reference in all major decisions
