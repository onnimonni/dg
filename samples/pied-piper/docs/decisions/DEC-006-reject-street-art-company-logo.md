## Context

After securing seed funding, we needed to establish Pied Piper's visual brand identity. Erlich connected us with Chuy Ramirez, a local street artist known for his bold, urban aesthetic.

Chuy proposed a graffiti-style logo featuring:
- A stylized rat playing a flute (playing on the Pied Piper legend)
- Spray paint texture and drip effects
- Neon colors (hot pink, electric blue)
- "PIED PIPER" in bubble letters

## Decision

**REJECTED**: The team unanimously decided against the street art logo proposal.

## DACI

| Role | Person |
|------|--------|
| Driver | @jared |
| Approver | @richard |
| Consulted | @dinesh, @gilfoyle |
| Informed | @erlich |

## Rationale

### Positive Aspects
- Unique and memorable
- Strong visual impact
- Captures startup energy

### Negative Aspects
- Too informal for enterprise B2B clients
- Difficult to reproduce on business cards/letterhead
- The rat imagery has negative connotations
- Could be seen as unprofessional by investors
- Erlich's insistence that "the rat represents our hunger" was unconvincing

### Neutral Considerations
- Could work for a consumer-facing brand
- The artist was talented but wrong fit for our market

## Outcome

We proceeded with a more professional design: the clean, modern geometric logo that better reflects our technology-focused positioning.

The street art concept was archived, though Erlich kept pushing for it during board meetings for several months afterward.

## Lessons Learned

1. Brand identity should align with target market expectations
2. Get multiple design proposals before committing
3. Erlich's taste in visual design should be taken with skepticism
