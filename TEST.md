# Testing

## Company level test

When OBJECTIVE.md is created use `dg` and create a monorepo which explains the Silicon Valley company Pied Piper from the first principles.

It should have some imaginary code and the decision tree that they made in the series.

After the decisions have been documented with `dg` the `dg` tool should be able to write some sort of onboarding document to the company and how to find information regarding the history and the chain of all decisions made so far.

It should be able to publish this into a static website with the company logo.

## Hobby level test

This should be usable in my "Safer currency handling in postgresql" project which I made from my bad experiences in many organizations. See more about that project in: https://github.com/fyffee/monetary
