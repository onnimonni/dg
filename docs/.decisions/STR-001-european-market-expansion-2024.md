# European Market Expansion 2024

## Introduction

We have achieved product-market fit in the US with $5M ARR and 85% gross retention. European expansion represents our largest growth opportunity with an addressable market 1.5x larger than US. This strategy defines our approach to entering Europe in 2024.

## Goals

1. Enter first European market by Q2 2024
2. Achieve $500K ARR from Europe by end of 2024
3. Establish legal entity and local operations
4. Build initial European customer reference base (5+ logos)

## Tenets

1. **Local presence matters** - We will not try to serve Europe remotely from US
2. **Compliance first** - GDPR and local regulations are non-negotiable
3. **Quality over speed** - One market done well beats three markets done poorly
4. **Existing customers first** - Leverage US multinationals with European operations

## State of the Business

### Current Metrics
- US ARR: $5M
- Gross retention: 85%
- Net retention: 110%
- CAC payback: 14 months

### Market Context
- European SaaS market growing 25% YoY
- GDPR has created demand for compliant solutions
- Local competitors lack our technical capabilities
- US-based competitors struggle with localization

### Competitive Position
- Strong: Technical platform, US customer references
- Weak: No European presence, limited EU compliance certification

## Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Market Selection
Choose first market based on: market size, regulatory complexity, language barriers, existing network. France and Germany are top candidates.

### Priority 2: Legal & Compliance Setup
Establish EU legal entity, achieve necessary certifications, set up local data infrastructure.

### Priority 3: Go-to-Market
Hire initial sales/support team, localize product, adapt pricing for local market.

## Resource Requirements

- **People**: 1 country manager, 2 sales reps, 1 support engineer
- **Budget**: $800K first year (legal, hiring, marketing, infrastructure)
- **Timeline**: Q1 prep, Q2 launch, Q3-Q4 scale
- **Dependencies**: Board approval, Series B funding

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Regulatory delays | Medium | High | Start compliance work in Q1 |
| Slow hiring | High | Medium | Use recruitment agency |
| Currency fluctuation | Low | Low | Price in EUR, hedge |
| Product localization issues | Medium | Medium | Hire native speakers early |

## FAQ

**Q: Why not start with UK?**
A: Brexit complications, prefer EU single market access. UK can be phase 2.

**Q: Can we serve Europe from US initially?**
A: No. Time zones, data residency, and local support expectations make this impractical.

**Q: What if first market fails?**
A: Learnings transfer to other markets. Budget assumes 18-month runway.
