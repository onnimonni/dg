# Expand to France before Germany

## Setting

As part of STR-001 (European Market Expansion), we need to choose our first European market. The decision has significant resource implications - we can only properly launch in one market initially. France and Germany are the two strongest candidates based on market size and strategic fit.

## People

- **Responsible**: VP of International (Marie)
- **Approvers**: CEO (Onni), Board
- **Consulted**: Sales, Legal, Product, Finance
- **Informed**: All staff

## Alternatives

### Option A: France First
**Pros:**
- Larger SaaS market ($12B vs $10B)
- Existing relationships via Acme Corp (CUS-001) who has French subsidiary
- More favorable regulatory timeline (6 weeks vs 12 weeks for setup)
- French tech ecosystem actively seeking US partnerships

**Cons:**
- Higher labor costs
- More complex labor laws
- Language barrier (fewer English speakers in business)

### Option B: Germany First
**Pros:**
- Stronger economy overall
- Higher English proficiency in business
- Gateway to DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- More conservative buying behavior = stickier customers

**Cons:**
- Longer company formation process (12+ weeks)
- Higher regulatory scrutiny
- No existing customer relationships
- More established local competition

### Option C: Launch Both Simultaneously
**Pros:**
- Faster total European coverage
- Can compare markets directly

**Cons:**
- Splits limited resources
- Higher execution risk
- Contradicts "one market done well" tenet from STR-001

## Decision

Chosen: **Option A: France First**

Rationale: France offers the fastest path to revenue through the Acme Corp relationship, shorter regulatory timeline, and larger addressable market. Germany will be Phase 2 (Q4 2024).

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster time to first European revenue (Q2 vs Q3)
- Can leverage existing Acme relationship for reference
- Lower initial setup costs
- Learnings inform Germany launch

### Negative
- Miss Germany DACH opportunity in 2024
- Need French-speaking staff
- Higher ongoing labor costs

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Begin French entity formation process
- [ ] Hire French country manager
- [ ] Initiate Acme Corp France expansion conversation
- [ ] Plan Germany Phase 2 for Q4 2024
