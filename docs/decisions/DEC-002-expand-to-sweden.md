# Expand to Sweden

## Setting

Following our successful French market entry (DEC-001), we need to decide whether Sweden should be our next European market. Sweden offers access to the Nordic tech ecosystem, including Spotify, Klarna, and King—all potential enterprise customers for Pied Piper's compression technology. The decision is urgent because Hooli is rumored to be exploring Nordic partnerships.

## People

- **Responsible**: Richard Hendricks (CEO)
- **Approvers**: Monica Hall (Board), Laurie Bream (Investor)
- **Consulted**: Jared Dunn (COO), Dinesh Chugtai (Engineering), Gilfoyle (Infrastructure)
- **Informed**: All employees, existing European customers

## Alternatives

### Option A: Enter Sweden via Stockholm

**Pros:**
- Largest Nordic tech hub with 70% of regional tech companies
- Strong developer community aligns with our go-to-market
- English widely spoken, reducing localization needs
- Gateway to Norway, Finland, Denmark

**Cons:**
- High labor costs and competitive hiring market
- Need to establish SEK banking (complexity)
- Distance from Paris operations

### Option B: Enter Norway via Oslo

**Pros:**
- Oil & gas industry has massive data processing needs
- Higher average contract values than Sweden
- Less competition from other SaaS vendors

**Cons:**
- Smaller tech ecosystem overall
- Not in EU (regulatory complexity)
- Limited gateway to other Nordics

### Option C: Enter All Nordics Simultaneously

**Pros:**
- Maximum market coverage
- Single launch marketing push
- Could win regional enterprise deals

**Cons:**
- Resource-intensive (4x the operational complexity)
- Dilutes focus, risks poor execution
- Banking setup in 4 countries simultaneously

## Decision

Chosen: **Option A: Enter Sweden via Stockholm**

Rationale: Sweden offers the best combination of market size, tech ecosystem density, and strategic positioning. As an EU member, it shares regulatory framework with France, reducing compliance overhead. The strong developer community matches our bottom-up sales motion. Norway and Finland can follow in Phase 2 once Stockholm operations are stable.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Access to €800M addressable market in Sweden alone
- Partnership opportunities with Spotify, Klarna, King
- Establishes Pied Piper as a pan-European player
- First-mover advantage before Hooli arrives

### Negative
- SEK currency exposure requires hedging strategy
- Hiring in Stockholm is competitive and expensive
- Stretches leadership attention across 3 markets (US, France, Sweden)

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Hire Nordic sales lead (Stockholm-based) by Q2 2024
- [ ] Establish banking relationship for SEK transactions (see DEC-004)
- [ ] Partner with Stockholm tech accelerator (SUP46 or STING)
- [ ] Launch Swedish-language customer support option
- [ ] Update data processing agreements for Swedish data residency
